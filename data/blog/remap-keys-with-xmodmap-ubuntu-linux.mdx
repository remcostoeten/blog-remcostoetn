## How to remap keys on PopOS (ubuntu) and probably other distros?

[xmodmap][xmopdmap-link] is needed here for the remapping. So go ahead and snap, sudo-apt or whatever you need to install it. Don't you dare to use a appimage or something like that.

```bash
sudo apt-get install xmodmap
```

### Remapping

Remaps are stored in a config file called `.Xmodmap` in your home directory. If it doesn't exist, create it. with `touch ~/.Xmodmap`. or just go ahead and `vim ~/.Xmodmap`. This will not work with nano, heck I suggest you find another tutorial if you use nano. <small>how to quit vi....</small>

Inside the file you can do your config magic. In this example I will remap the right shift to the right arrow ke which is done like so:

```bash
clear shift
keycode 62 = Right NoSymbol Right
add shift = Shift_R
```

As you see you need the keycode which is easily opbtained through running `xev` in your terminal and there will appear a small gui which prints out some magic when pressed. For other syntax refer to xmodmap docs.

`!:wq` and reload the config with `xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap` and you are done.
